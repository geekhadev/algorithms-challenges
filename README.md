# Algorithms challenges

[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)

Repository to upload algorithm challenges, you can find exercises of different levels, platforms and programming languages.

## üöÄ The goal

It means doing at least one daily exercise on algorithms, practicing them in different programming languages. Today is December 4, 2024, so I have already started late and in some days I will have to do more than one exercise.

## üìö Platforms

- [X] [codesignal](https://codesignal.com/)
- [X] [adventjs-2023](https://adventjs.dev/es/challenges/2023)

Every time I get an exercise from a platform I will add it to this list.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Languages

In this list of languages I will add the languages that I practice. Surely there will be many that I don't like so I won't try it ;-)

- [X] JavaScript
- [X] TypeScript
- [X] Python
- [X] PHP
- [ ] Rust
- [ ] SQL

## ‚úÖ Exercises list

All the exercises will be in the 'src' folder, at the root of the repository, each exercise will have a folder, an explanation and hopefully time will give me its corresponding tests.
